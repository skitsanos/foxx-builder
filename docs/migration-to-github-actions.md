# Migration from Circle CI to GitHub Actions

This document outlines the migration from Circle CI to GitHub Actions for the foxx-builder project.

## What Changed

### Removed
- `.circleci/config.yml` - Circle CI configuration
- Circle CI status badge from README.md
- Circle CI references from deployment scripts

### Added
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml` - Code quality checks
- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Workflow documentation
- GitHub Actions status badges in README.md

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Circle CI | GitHub Actions | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| ArangoDB Service | ‚úÖ Docker | ‚úÖ Service Container | ‚úÖ Equivalent |
| Bun Runtime | ‚úÖ Manual Install | ‚úÖ Official Action | ‚úÖ Improved |
| Foxx CLI | ‚úÖ Global Install | ‚úÖ Global Install | ‚úÖ Equivalent |
| Hurl Testing | ‚úÖ Manual Install | ‚úÖ Manual Install | ‚úÖ Equivalent |
| Test Reporting | ‚úÖ CircleCI Native | ‚úÖ Actions + Artifacts | ‚úÖ Improved |
| Database Setup | ‚úÖ Docker Exec | ‚úÖ REST API | ‚úÖ Equivalent |
| Deployment | ‚ùå Not Included | ‚úÖ Automated | üÜï New Feature |
| Code Quality | ‚ùå Not Included | ‚úÖ Multi-job | üÜï New Feature |
| Security Scanning | ‚ùå Not Included | ‚úÖ Included | üÜï New Feature |

## New Features

### 1. Automated Deployments
- Deploy on git tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Manual deployments with environment selection
- Health checks after deployment
- Automatic GitHub releases

### 2. Code Quality Checks
- ESLint integration
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Documentation validation
- Dependency health checks

### 3. Environment Management
- Separate staging and production environments
- Environment-specific secrets
- Protected deployments with reviews

## Required Setup

### 1. Repository Secrets

Add these secrets in GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions:

```
ARANGO_HOST=https://your-arangodb-server.com
ARANGO_DATABASE=your_database_name
ARANGO_USERNAME=your_deployment_user
ARANGO_PASSWORD=your_deployment_password
```

### 2. Environment Protection (Optional)

Set up protected environments for production deployments:

1. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Environments
2. Create `production` environment
3. Add required reviewers
4. Restrict to specific branches

## Migration Benefits

### Cost Efficiency
- GitHub Actions includes 2,000 free minutes/month
- No additional service subscription needed
- Integrated with existing GitHub workflow

### Improved Developer Experience
- Native GitHub integration
- Better visibility in pull requests
- Unified platform for code and CI/CD

### Enhanced Security
- Built-in security scanning
- Environment-based secret management
- Audit logs and access controls

### Better Reporting
- Test results directly in pull requests
- Artifact storage for build outputs
- Workflow visualization and debugging

## Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to master/main/develop**: Runs CI pipeline and code quality checks
- **Pull Request**: Runs all checks before merge
- **Git Tags (v*)**: Triggers deployment to production

### Manual Triggers
- **Deploy Workflow**: Can be triggered manually with environment selection
- **Workflow Dispatch**: All workflows support manual execution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Secrets Not Set**
   - Verify all required secrets are configured
   - Check secret names match exactly

2. **ArangoDB Connection Issues**
   - Service containers take time to initialize
   - Health checks should wait for readiness

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure deployment user has Foxx service permissions
   - Verify database access rights

### Debug Steps

1. Enable debug logging:
   ```
   ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true
   ```

2. Check workflow logs in Actions tab

3. Use manual workflow dispatch for testing

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the original Circle CI configuration can be restored from git history:

```bash
# View the removed configuration
git show HEAD~1:.circleci/config.yml

# Restore if needed (not recommended)
git checkout HEAD~1 -- .circleci/
```

However, GitHub Actions provides superior functionality and integration, making rollback unnecessary.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Update repository secrets
2. ‚úÖ Test workflows with a pull request
3. ‚úÖ Configure branch protection rules
4. ‚úÖ Set up environment protection for production
5. ‚úÖ Update any external documentation or integration points
6. ‚úÖ Train team on new workflow features

## Support

For issues with the new GitHub Actions setup:

1. Check the [workflow documentation](.github/workflows/README.md)
2. Review workflow logs in the Actions tab
3. Create an issue in the repository for assistance
